# Cave Explorer
## Time to Explore!
You are a bueatiful dot who wants nothing more than to explore a massive cave. Unfortunately gravity is not being very helpful to you (idk why it won't just help you, but whatever.) You need to avoid hitting ceilings and falling to your death, but lukily, your desire to explore overcomes the fear of death.

Keep your dot floating by hitting the **SPACEBAR**. The farther in you go the quicker you will move, making it harder to predict and adjust to the steep falls and climbs of the cave walls.
